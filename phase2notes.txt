Meeting Minutes 5/5/22


WHAT WE DID:
moved mapper and file manager into a dll
moved reducer, trie and file manager into a dll
linked both to the main file which has main, workflow and tests
fixed dll code

ISSUES:
something went wrong with the linking

TO DO:
explicitly link the dlls to load in at runtime
fix linking
test and see if it runs
ask if theres anything else missing that we need to do
ask about file manager class (is it okay that its included in each dll)
	can i just provide filemanager files to paste into dlls
